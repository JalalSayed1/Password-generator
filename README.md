# About the project:

 - Random password generator.
 - Password generated will be copied to user's clipboard automatically.
 - password will always starts and ends with a character to avoid problems with some systems where they do not accept passwords to starts or ends with numbers or special characters.
 - Passwords generated contains UPPERCASE letters, lowercase letters, digits and symbols.
 - Symbols used from the String module punctuations. Which are: !"#$%&'()*+, -./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
 - Password length between 15 and 29 characters.

# Usage:
`python <filename> <int> <int>`
 - filename: password.py
 - First int: MIN length of password required.
 - Second int: MAX length of password required.

# What did I learn from this:

 - Using String, random, sys and pyperclip Python modules.
 - List comprehension Python.

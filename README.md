# About the project:

- Random password generator.
- Password generated will be copied to the user's clipboard automatically.
- A password will always start and ends with a character to avoid problems with some systems where that do not accept passwords to start or end with numbers or special characters.
- Passwords generated contain UPPERCASE letters, lowercase letters, digits and symbols.
- Symbols used from the String module punctuations. Which are: !"#$%&'()*+, -./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|}~
- Password length is between 15 and 29 characters.

# Usage:
`python <filename> <int> <int>`
 - filename: password.py
 - First int: MIN length of password required.
 - Second int: MAX length of password required.

# What did I learn from this:

 - Using String, random, sys and pyperclip python modules.
 - List comprehension in python.
